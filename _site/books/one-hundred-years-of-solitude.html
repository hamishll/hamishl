    <p>This book follows a Colombian family over 5 generations, from its Genesis in founding the town of Macondo, ultimately to its end over a hundred years later.</p>

<p>There are elements of fantasy throughout, which does add to the charm of the novel. As time progresses and society modernises, you get the sense of the world losing its magic and becoming more grounded in reality. This is similar to the overall narrative of the book - the founding of Macondo is heralded by gypsies bringing all manner of  surreal creations to the town, and similarly the early blossoming of the family and the the town feels very vibrant. As the book, and the family matures, there’s a greater feeling of lethargy and succumbing to inevitable destiny. The solitude of the characters becomes more and more apparent - despite being a large family, they all seem to be very isolated from each other. There are some last moments of sparks as the ember of the family dies out, and there is a sense of finality as the predictions made at the start of the book play out.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the book ends with the destruction of the family and the town, through both internal and external factors. There’s a sadness to the erosion of the family story to nothingness which is greater than the individual passing of its members. All the memories that adorned the town of Macondo fade into nothingness as weather, political and economic factors force its inhabitants away. I found the transience of the impact we have on others and the limited number of generations we are remembered affected me significantly.</p>

<p>The characters’ realisations as to how they really felt about each other often came too late in their lives, often in response to their deaths. Frequently these realisations take the form of regrets in a life of loneliness. I think the need to appreciate who we have in our lives now, to appreciate our family and accept their shortcomings, is conveyed well.</p>

<p>Over several generations of Buendia’s, each have their own stories, however they each have their own vices. There’s a big theme of these vices being shared by subsequent generations, as though they were all destined to live out a cyclical repetition of each other. There are moments of humour and sadness, although I felt each of the 20+ descendant’s stories weren’t covered in enough detail for me to truly connect with each of them, which I thought lessoned the emotional impact of the story for me.</p>

<p>There were parts I really liked, specifically Fernanda’s reflections on her solitude, and how her tracking of time by the dates of returning visits of her children (page 368) and her feelings of nostalgia (page 370). If the rest of the book had moved me as these pages had, it would certainly be a favourite of mine.</p>

<p>Overall, being on holiday during this read made it possible, although I think I would have struggled to persist otherwise. Overall, the book felt more like a reeling off of incidents that occurred over several generations, and less an exploration of the emotions of each of its many characters. Keeping track of the many shared names, in particular the similarly sounding Aurelianos and Arcadios, was a struggle. Despite this, the book was thought-provoking enough for me to spend quite a while reflecting on it, so I have that to appreciate. I wish I enjoyed it more, as I know this book does resonate strongly with many readers.</p>
