I"ß<h1 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h1>

<p class="nutshell">Combine desire with faith to autosuggest achievements to your
subconscious mind. Have a specific mission statement and repeat it twice
daily. Successful people know their purpose, which makes them decisive
and persistent. Seek out others who share your desires and motivations;
the collective mind is powerful and they will inspire you to be better.
Make decisions promptly and confidently, but don‚Äôt be afraid to adapt
and change course if necessary.</p>
