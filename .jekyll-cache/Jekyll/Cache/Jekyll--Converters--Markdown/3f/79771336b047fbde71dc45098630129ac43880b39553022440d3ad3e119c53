I"?<p>Ray Bradbury makes some interesting predictions of a post-literature world - full of hyper-stimulation and fear of the power of knowledge. These themes are more relevant now than ever, in an age of streaming, notifications, services on demand and fake news.</p>

<p>Reading allows one to take that lazy stroll through a story with plenty of time to pause and reflect, leaving as much as possible to interpretation and imagination. The benefits of this, and of slowing down and considering one’s situation and emotions, is starting to become more widely recognised.</p>

<p>Ray Bradbury’s total adoration of books resonates throughout the book and the Afterword. Whilst his storytelling isn’t the most intricate, or his language the most poetic, the themes of this book are strong and convey ideas ahead of their time.</p>
