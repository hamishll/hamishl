# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
...

*This summary is mainly based on Siver's excellent summary*





# The common mistakes of how we look at life

If you lack a grand goal in life, you lack a coherent philosophy of life. Don't look back on life from your deathbed and realise you spent your life pursuing things that weren't truly valuable.

Consider what things you might pursue that are the most valuable to you. Find delight in what you have and overcome your insatiability.


# The Stoic's method

If you expect bad things to happen, then you won't be so sad when they do. Conversely, if you expect good fortune you will be disappointed when it is not achieved.

We are unhappy because we are insatiable, and typically lose interest in the things we achieve, giving rise to even greater desires.

So, the easiest way to be happy is to want the things we already have. If we imagine for a moment that we have lost the things we value then we will appreciate them more. We should periodically pause and consider that we may lose things; that we won't live forever. Similarly, we are living in a dream world compared to our ancestors - let us not take that for granted. If an optimism is thankful for a glass half-full, than a Stoic is not only thankful for the water, but for the glass itself!

There will be a last time you see falling snow, smell popcorn, feel the warmth of a child asleep in your arms. Recognising this will help you make the most of these moments, with an intensity that would otherwise be absent.


# The difference between contemplation and worry

There is a difference between contemplating something bad happening and worrying about it. Contemplation is an intellectual exercise, and should not involve your emotions.

A father who periodically contemplates the loss of his daughter will appreciate her very much. Conversely, a father who assumes his daughter will be with him forever will take her for granted.



# Unfufilled desires and happiness don't coexist

We will never be truly happy if we yearn for more; if we aren't satiated. Instead, we should only want things that are easy to obtain.
*Note: there are some obvious drawbacks to this lack of commitment, depending on how you look at life*

The key is to value things that are truly important, not those that are superficial. 

Don't focus on changing the world, but just doing what you can to help.

The first step to living a good life is to teach yourself how to make your happiness depends as little as possible on your external circumstances.



# Criticism

If you respect someone and value their opinions, then you should not feel hurt by their criticism, but instead relieved. Care less about what other people think.



# Grief

Through *"retrospective negative visualisation"*, we imagine having never had something we have lost. We can replace these feelings of loss with a feeling of gratitude for having once had something. 

When we lose things, we can't help but feel a bout of reflexive grief. The difference comes after, when a Stoic will try to dispel what grief remains. For example, if we lose someone we love, a Stoic might think "that person would not want me to be unhappy - the best way to honor them is to forget grieving and enjoy life"



# Valuing life as we age

Imagine what it is like to be old, and don't take for granted the abilities your health grants you - being able to run, jump and party all night.

**The most delightful time of life is when it is on the downward slope**. It is at this point that we start to truly appreciate what we have. When we are young, we assume we will live forever, and take our days for granted and waste them. When we are old, waking up each morning can be a cause for celebration.



# A coherent philosophy of life

Philosophies of life have two components: 1. they tell us what things are worth and aren't worth pursuing, and 2. they tell us how to gain the things that *are* worth having.

Consider social status for example. Whilst it might have been useful in evolutionary terms to seek social status, that no longer has to be the case. Instead, we should focus on being happy with who we are. 

A huge number of people make the mistake of following their evolutionary programming; desiring more things, more status. Seeking out things that feel good and avoiding those that feel bad. Having a philosophy of life a allows us to override these base instincts, and seek satisfaction and happiness.

We have a coherent philosophy of life when *we know what we want to value and want to achieve*. If we follow this philosophy we will likely attain these things (as much as we can), and thus we will not feel dissatisfied when we are on our deathbed.

If we do not have a coherent philosophy of life, we will be convinced that what we want is *more of everything*, and thus we won't be satisfied.


# Practical steps to Stoicism

-	Engage in *negative visualisation* each night at bedtime
-	Do your best to accept the past, and embrace the present
-	Refuse to think "if only" thoughts


# My notes on this book

Humans have very short-term persepectives. After something good happens, we soon tend to revert to an unsatisfied state of desire. If we take a step back, we can see that we have a wonderful life (especially compared to those of previous generations).

I think of Stoicism as a way of looking at life which prevents us from reverting to this equilibrium. By considering how much worse things could be, that we could lose the things we value, we gain an appreciation for what we have and our desires can be sated. 

On a practical level, Stoicism suggests we not only consider losses, but periodically experience them to ensure we don't take things for granted.
