    <h1 id="what-is-strategy-michael-porter">What is Strategy? (Michael Porter)</h1>

<h3 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h3>

<p class="nutshell">Companies strive to improve <strong>operational effectiveness</strong>, but if all
competitors adopt the same practices then competitive convergence
occurs, giving the advantage to no one.
<strong>Strategic positioning</strong> aims to provide a sustainable advantage by
using what is distinct about a company; either through performing
<em>different</em> activities from rivals, or <em>similar</em> activities in different
ways.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position. Achieved
through:
    <ul>
      <li>Serving specific needs for many customers (eg: Jiffy Lube providing
only auto lubricants)</li>
      <li>Serving broad needs for few customers (eg: wealth managers target
few high-value clients)</li>
      <li>Serving broad needs for many customers in a narrow market (eg:
Carmike Cinemas only operate in towns of less than 200k population</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Strategy requires you to decide what <em>not</em> to do, and focus on more
specific goals
    <ul>
      <li>Positioning yourself in one area happens at the expense of other
areas, so it’s important to pick the best one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Strategy involves creating “fit” with your company’s activities
    <ul>
      <li>A company’s activities should all work to the same principles. Eg:
Vanguard strives for low-cost operation with low portfolio turnover</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="five-competitive-forces-that-shape-strategy-michael-porter">Five Competitive Forces that Shape Strategy (Michael Porter)</h1>

<h3 id="in-a-nutshell-1">In a nutshell</h3>

<ul class="nutshell">
  <li><strong>Established rivals</strong> – compete intensely on price</li>
  <li><strong>Aspiring entrants</strong> – can disrupt by targeting unserved areas of the
market</li>
  <li><strong>Savvy customers</strong> – can force prices down by playing you and your
competitors against each other</li>
  <li><strong>Powerful suppliers</strong> – may constrain you if they can charge higher
profits with impunity</li>
  <li><strong>Substitute offerings</strong> – can lure customers away</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Position your company where the forces are weakest
    <ul>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Exploit changes in these forces
    <ul>
      <li>Example: the advent of the internet created an untapped market for
digital music sales. Apple stepped into this market with iTunes and
have been dominant players since</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reshape the forces in your favour
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neutralise supplier power:</strong> by standardising specifications for
parts so your company can more-easily switch vendors</li>
      <li><strong>Counter customer power:</strong> by expanding your services so it is
harder / less convenient for customers to leave you for a rival</li>
      <li><strong>Minimise price wars with established rivals:</strong> by investing in
products that differ significantly from competitors’ offerings</li>
      <li><strong>Scare off new entrants:</strong> by elevating the cost of competing, such
as increasing R&amp;D expenditure</li>
      <li><strong>Limit the threat of substitutes:</strong> by making your product more
accessible (soft drink manufacturers did this by introducing vending
machines which made soft drinks more available than other beverages)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="building-your-companys-vision-james-collins">Building Your Company’s Vision (James Collins)</h1>

<h3 id="in-a-nutshell-2">In a nutshell</h3>

<p class="nutshell">Enduring companies have clear plans for how they will advance into an
uncertain future. However, they are also equally clear about how they
will remain steadfast in the values and purposes they will always stand
for. These two principles can be split into a <strong>core ideology</strong> and
<strong>envisioned future</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Core ideology
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core values</strong> are the guiding principles by which a company
navigates. They require no justification.</li>
      <li><strong>Core purpose</strong> is the organisation’s fundamental reason for being;
what the consumer gains from their products (eg: Disney make people
happy)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Envisioned future
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals (BHAGs)</strong> are ambitious plans that
motivate the company, typically taking a few decades to complete.
These may be quantitative (be valued £Xm), transformative (change in
market), competitive (outsell competitor X).</li>
      <li><strong>Vivid descriptions</strong> paint a picture of a world in which these
goals are achieved</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="blue-ocean-strategy-w-kim">Blue Ocean Strategy (W. Kim)</h1>

<h3 id="in-a-nutshell-3">In a nutshell</h3>

<p class="nutshell">The best way to achieve profitable growth is to stop competing in overcrowded industries, so called <em>red oceans</em>. Conversely, <em>blue oceans</em> are uncontested market spaces where you invent and capture new demand.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s not about technology innovation
    <ul>
      <li>Blue ocean creators usually take existing technology and link it to what buyers value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You don’t need to venture into distant waters to create blue oceans
    <ul>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>​Never use the competition as a benchmark
    <ul>
      <li>Instead make the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for both yourself and the customer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reduce your costs while offering customers more value
    <ul>
      <li>By offering something unique you can increase demand, which typically lowers cost due to economies of scale.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="the-secrets-to-successful-strategy-execution">The Secrets to Successful Strategy Execution</h1>

<h3 id="in-a-nutshell-4">In a nutshell</h3>

<p class="nutshell">There are two main levers that affect strategy execution: <strong>clarifying decision rights</strong> and <strong>ensuring information flows where it is needed</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clarifying decision rights
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that everyone knows which decisions and actions they are responsible for. Make people accountable for their end result.</li>
      <li>Encourage managers to delegate operational decisions. This frees up time and prevents stalling due to lack of authorisation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Information flow
    <ul>
      <li>Increase open, honest communication between management and staff. This can be achieved through more informal meetings, such as brown-bag lunches.</li>
      <li>Improve information flow between different teams, perhaps by increasing cross-functional work and more informal engagements.</li>
      <li class="star">Help line employees understand how their day-to-day choices affect your company’s bottom line.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Some good generic tactics that can be applied:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make upper management just <em>support</em> lower level decision making</li>
  <li>Focus upper management instead on important strategic questions</li>
  <li>Clarify and streamline decision making at each operating level</li>
  <li>Consolidate similar functions into one organisational unit</li>
  <li>Establish individual performance measures</li>
  <li>Improve field-to-management information flow</li>
  <li>Define and distribute daily operating metrics to employees</li>
  <li>Create cross-functional teams</li>
  <li>Expand nonmonetary rewards to recognise exceptional performers</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="using-the-balanced-scorecard-as-a-strategic-management-system">Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System</h1>

<h3 id="in-a-nutshell-5">In a nutshell</h3>

<p class="nutshell">We can use the Balanced Scorecard to avoid budgets ignoring important non-financial factors, such as customer service, internal processes, and employee growth.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Translating the vision
    <ul>
      <li>The progress of each factor in the scoreboard should be measurable, so that managers agreed on what constitutes good performance in that factor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communicating and linking
    <ul>
      <li>By using scorecards at each level of the organisation, each employee can see how their work affects results.</li>
      <li>This can be tied to individual targets and compensation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Business planning
    <ul>
      <li>The strategy and budgeting teams should work together, to make sure budgets adequately support strategic goals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feedback and learning
    <ul>
      <li>It’s important to reflect on progress; what’s working and what isn’t. Having a mechanism for feedback helps the company continuously improve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
