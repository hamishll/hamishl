<p class="nutshell">Sleeping for less than 8 hours a night can have serious implications for many different aspects of health. Having good quality, efficient sleep:
 <br /> - improves memory
 <br /> - increases creativity
 <br /> - reduces chance of injury
 <br /> - increases testosterone and HGH
 <br /> - reduces cravings
 <br /> - reduces weight loss from lean muscle
 <br /> - reduces risk of catching illness
 <br /> - protects against cancer
 <br /> - protects against dementia
 <br /> - lowers risk of heart attack and stroke
 <br /> - makes you look more attractive
 <br /> - improves mood
 <br /> - reduces depression and anxiety</p>

<p>If sleep were a new prescription drug, people would pay thousands for it, but sleep is <em>free</em></p>

<h1 id="twelve-tips-for-healthy-sleep">Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. If there is one piece of advice you follow, it should be this.</li>
  <li>Exercise, but not later than 2-3 hours before your bedtime.</li>
  <li>Avoid caffeine, it can take as long as eight hours to wear off fully.</li>
  <li>Avoid alcohol before bed.</li>
  <li>Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. Drinking too many fluids at night can cause frequent awakenings.</li>
  <li>Avoid medecines that disrupt your sleep.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt nap after 3pm.</li>
  <li>Relax before bed - read.</li>
  <li>Take a hot bath before bed.</li>
  <li>Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.</li>
  <li>Daylight is key to regulating sleep patterns.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt lie in bed awake - if sleep doesn‚Äôt reach you within 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing for a while.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="part-1-about-sleep---factors-that-affect-sleep">Part 1: About Sleep - Factors that affect sleep</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Circadian Rhythm
    <ul>
      <li>is on average 24hrs 15m</li>
      <li>is independent to external stimuli, but can be tuned by sunlight to run on 24hr</li>
      <li>influences processes that control sleepiness, such as body temperature</li>
      <li>the profile of body temperature can skew in ‚Äúmorning types‚Äù vs ‚Äúevening types‚Äù, so forcing evening types into an early-bird schedule can result in long-term sleep deprivation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Melatonin
    <ul>
      <li>Released at night (when dark)</li>
      <li>Makes you feel sleepy</li>
      <li>Peaks around 1AM</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adenosine (‚Äúsleep pressure‚Äù)
    <ul>
      <li>Adenosine builds up during waking hours and decays during sleep</li>
      <li>Caffeine latches onto adenosine welcome sites in the brain, preventing adenosine from doing so</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All of these factors combine to give us a profile of wakefulness:

The delta between the dashed and solid line describes how sleepy we feel.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Characteristics of sleep
    <ul>
      <li>Motor and sensory signals are blocked by the thalamus during sleep</li>
      <li>Sleep Phases:
Ôøº</li>
      <li>Approximately 90 minute cycles</li>
      <li>Both NREM and REM are equally important, but for the different functions they perform</li>
      <li>During REM sleep, real events are replayed, at 25-50% real speed</li>
      <li>the first half of the night is majority NREM sleep</li>
      <li>the second half of the night is majority REM sleep</li>
      <li>Sleeping six hours instead of eight means you lose 25% of your total sleep, but 60-90% of your REM sleep</li>
      <li>This works the other way round as well - if you go to bed two hours later, you lose most of your NREM sleep</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Frequencies and Waves
Ôøº
    <ul>
      <li>NREM</li>
      <li>During NREM, brain cells fire in-sync with each other and constructive interference creates these deep, broad waves</li>
      <li>Analogous to FM vs AM, AM is lower frequency and travels further as a result</li>
      <li>These slow, synchronous waves allow communication between distant regions of the brain * check the science here</li>
      <li>This allows us to move memories from short-term to long-term storage</li>
      <li>REM</li>
      <li>Whereas NREM is all about storage, REM is all about integrating memories into our model of the world</li>
      <li>We experience vivid hallucinations, with ideas and experiences melding and forming links between related concepts</li>
      <li>During REM sleep, the muscles of the body are ‚Äòcut-off‚Äô from the brain stem, preventing us from potentially disastrous repercussions of our dreams</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Origins of Sleep
    <ul>
      <li>Worms that emerged 500 million years ago exhibit sleeping behaviour</li>
      <li>Going even further back, unicellular organisms also rest according to the day/night cycle</li>
      <li>Some animals barely sleep - giraffes and elephants get 4 hours</li>
      <li>Some animals sleep loads - tigers, bats, possums get 15-19 hours</li>
      <li>There‚Äôs no clear rule, but diet, metabolism, and social structures can be indicative</li>
      <li>Generally a higher metabolic rate requires more ‚Äòclean-up‚Äô through sleep</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dreaming
    <ul>
      <li>Only birds and mammals have proper REM sleep</li>
      <li>Partially aquatic mammals can‚Äôt enter REM sleep when on sea as the muscle paralysis would cause them to drown, so they subsist on a snooze diet of NREM sleep</li>
      <li>If sleep deprived, the body will rebound into extra NREM on the first night sleeping, and then favour extra REM on subsequent nights</li>
      <li>Note we can never properly ‚Äúsleep back‚Äù the sleep we have lost</li>
      <li>Whilst we don‚Äôt have split-brains like birds or dolphins, when sleeping in unfamiliar environments, one half of the brain won‚Äôt sleep as deep as the other</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Monophasic or Biphasic sleep?
    <ul>
      <li>All humans have a hardwired dip in alertness in the mid-afternoon hours</li>
      <li>Napping has been a part of many cultures historically</li>
      <li>In a study that followed the abandoning of siesta culture in Spain showed that those who gave up siestas suffered a 37% great chance of CHD</li>
      <li>Biphasic sleep appears to be a healthy habit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Us vs primates
    <ul>
      <li>Primates sleep markedly longer, 10-15 hrs</li>
      <li>However we spend 25% of our sleep in REM whilst primates spend 9%</li>
      <li>Sleeping on the ground allowed us to grab more REM sleep, as we didn‚Äôt have to worry about falling out of trees from REM‚Äôs paralysing effects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="changes-in-the-type-of-sleep-as-we-age">Changes in the type of sleep as we age</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Pre-birth: (NREM/REM is 50/50 in infancy)
    <ul>
      <li>REM peaks in the last week before birth, at 12 hours per day!</li>
      <li>Autistic individuals have ~40% less REM sleep. Depriving infant rats of REM sleep causes symptoms similar to autism.</li>
      <li>Alcohol also prevents REM sleep, so expecting mothers who drink also inflict less REM sleep on their unborn child, around 25% less</li>
      <li>Breathing rate of the fetus can drop from 381 beats per hour to just 4 beats per hour</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Childhood (NREM/REM is 70/30 age 5)
    <ul>
      <li>Children‚Äôs rhythms run on an earlier schedule</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adolescence (NREM/REM is 80/20 in adulthood)
    <ul>
      <li>Increased proportion of NREM during adolescence leads to brain matuation. In particular, the frontal lobe, associated with rational decision-making is one of last regions to develop.</li>
      <li>Disrupting NREM in trials resulted in delayed brain mauration
 During puberty, th circadian rhythm shifts to later, much to the frustration of parents - <strong>asking your teenage child to go to sleep at 10pm is the equivalent of asking you to go to sleep at 7 or 8 pm</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Older age
    <ul>
      <li>Older adults still need as much sleep, but for various reasons aren‚Äôt able to obtain the level of sleep they require</li>
      <li>By the time we reach 70, we‚Äôll have lost 80% of your NREM sleep</li>
      <li>Most elderly individuals fail to connect their deteriorating health with their deterioration in sleep</li>
      <li>A lower level of <em>sleep efficiency</em> (the proportion of time you were asleep when in bed) increases mortality risk.</li>
      <li>Sleep disruption is a casual factor contributing to dementia</li>
      <li>Older adults often want to stay awake later but an earlier circadian rhythm can cause them to end up napping in the early-evening which makes it hard to fall asleep at night gets them into a sleep debt cycle, being awoken early by their early circadian rhythm.</li>
      <li>Brain deterioration is what causes this inability to generate deep sleep. Beta-amyloid, a key cause of Alzheimer‚Äôs, is flushed away 10-20x faster during NREM.</li>
      <li>Treating sleep disorders has been tentatively shown to reduce Alzheimers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h2 id="benefits-of-sleep-for-the-brain">Benefits of sleep for the brain</h2>
<p>Sleep improves your mental and physical health, protects you from disease, and even makes you fitter and look more attractive. If sleep were a new prescription drug, people would pay thousands for it, but sleep is <em>free</em>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shakespeare once said sleep is <em>‚Äúthe chief nourisher in life‚Äôs feast‚Äù</em></li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Benefits on learning
    <ul>
      <li>Those who napped in one study had a 20% learning advantage</li>
      <li>Sleeping, in particular NREM sleep with lots of spindles, moves memories to long-term storage, allowing more learning to continue</li>
      <li>Researchers have been able to boost the amplitude of spindles with electrodes, and even by playing tones at the same frequency of these spindles - showing a 40% memory enhancement.</li>
      <li>Practice makes perfect: in particular, practice, followed by sleep is a great way to improve performance. For example, sleeping after learning a piece of piano music can lead to significantly better performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Benefits on sports performance
    <ul>
      <li>Usain Bolt has been known to nap hours before breaking world records.</li>
      <li>Sleep also lowers the risk of sports injury significantly [image]</li>
      <li>Similarly positive stats can be shown for NBA players</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dangers-of-inadequate-sleep">Dangers of inadequate sleep</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Every hour, someone in the US dies in a fatigue-related traffic accident
    <ul>
      <li>Momentary, total lapses in concentration, called microsleeps, are usually suffered by individals who are chronically sleep restricted.</li>
      <li>4 hours of sleep for six nights leads to as bad performance as being 24-hour sleep deprived</li>
      <li><strong>6 hours of sleep for ten nights leads to as bad performance as being 24-hour sleep deprived</strong></li>
      <li>Being awake for 19 hours leads to as poor performance as people who were legally drunk [image]</li>
      <li>More dangerous are drowsy truckers. 80% are overweight and 50% are obese, leading to much higher risk of sleep apnea, and chronic sleep deprivation as a result.</li>
      <li>This leads to a 200-500% greater likelihood of being involved in a traffic acccident, and <strong>when truckers lose their life in a crash, they will on average take 4.5 other lives with them.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Emotional irrationality
    <ul>
      <li>Sleep-deprived individuals show a 60% amplification in emotional reactivity</li>
      <li>The <em>striatum</em>, associated with impulsivity and reward, become hyperactive as well</li>
      <li>Insufficient sleep increases suicidal thoughts and determines the relapse rates of numerous addiction disorders</li>
      <li><em>‚ÄúThe best bridge between despair and hope is a good night‚Äôs sleep‚Äù</em> - E. Joseph Cossman</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cancers and Heart Disease
    <ul>
      <li>20 large-scale studies on sleep have tracked millions of people and all found the same conclusion - the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.</li>
      <li>Shorter sleep is assoiated with 45% greater risk of CHD, and sleeping under six hours gives a 400% greater risk of cardiac arrest.</li>
      <li>One night of mad sleep increases blood pressure - <strong>when clocks change in March, we lose one hour of sleep opportunity, which results in a frightening spike in heart attacks</strong>. This works in reverse as well - thee are fewer heart attacks after we gain an hour in Autumn.</li>
      <li>Growth hormone is shut off when sleep deprived.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Diabetes and Overeating
    <ul>
      <li>After a week of sleeping 4 hours a night, participants in a study were 40% less effective at absorbing glucose.</li>
      <li>Ghrelin triggers a sense of hunger, and Leptim signals a sense of feeling full. These increase and decrease respectively when sleep deprived.</li>
      <li><strong>Sleep-deprived individuals desired 600 more calories</strong></li>
      <li>70% of weight lost when sleep-deprived comes from lean body mass, along with a marked drop in testosterone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Appearance
    <ul>
      <li>Faces after one night of short sleep were rated as looking less healthy and significantly less attractive - reinforcing the idea of ‚Äúbeauty sleep‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Illness
    <ul>
      <li>Those who got five hours sleep had 50% chance of catching a cold</li>
      <li>Those who got seven hours sleep had 18% chance of catching a cold</li>
      <li>Similarly, response to vaccines are significantly reduced by lack of sleep.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
