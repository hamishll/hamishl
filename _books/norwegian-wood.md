# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
Big theme of loss, grief, hopelessness, and hope. Both Naoko and Midori encounter loss but approach it in different ways (that’s not to say their losses are comparable or equal)
On a more positive note, it’s a story of working out what you want and wrestling with decisions on what kind of love you want (deep slow Vs passionate), and how selfish/hedonistic one should be in trying to pursue happiness

1. Naoko
* Regression into grief and hopelessness
* Existence in purgatory (the hostel) that makes it impossible to move on
* Her not wanting Watanabe to see her when she was unwell; a total loss of self confidence through hopelessness
* By the end of the book you see her as this haunted figure who was half-dead when Kizuki died 

2. Midori
* Her coping strategy for grief is to distract and dive into life
* She talks tough even when she feels so strongly for Watanabe
* It’s a protection mechanism, but a way of looking at things that I’m more aligned to personally - people overvalue dwelling on sad events; distraction is a valid way to recover faster 

3. Watanabe
* The loneliness during Spring is well written
* The way Murakami conveys his despair after Naoko’s death is beautifully written in the saddest way
* There’s this closure; a sense of relief once Naoko dies which you can’t help but feel, and it feels almost wrong to feel that way
* Wasn’t expecting the sleeping with Reiko part; is it a device for letting go of the intense feelings for Naoko’s death that they both shared
* A character stuck between committing to someone he’d committed his heart to, and the person who could make him happy; and this feeling of duty trumping his own desire for happiness - what’s right? To hurt the other or hurt yourself
