# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
Saving early is essential for maximising growth. Equity markets have
consistently delivered the best returns, and investing in index fund
ETFs and international markets provide good growth and spread risk

1.  Millennials aren’t investing their money
-   The 2001 and 2008 recessions have made millennials sceptical of
    investing in equity markets
-   However, stock markets have seen greater returns than all other
    asset classes

1.  Millennials’ greatest advantage is their youth
-   £1 invested in equities today could be worth £15 by retirement in 40
    years
-   If one waited 10 years to start investing, it would be worth only
    £7.50 (30 years)
-   This is the equivalent of 9.5%pa

1.  A recipe for investment
-   **Go global** – many investors miss out on good opportunities by
    only investing in domestic stocks. Developing countries have massive
    growing consumer demand and untapped natural resources. Investing
    globally also offers a hedge against a weakening domestic currency
    (Brexit!)
-   **Be different** – buying index funds are a great way to begin and
    ensures a broad portfolio
-   **Get out of your own way** – don’t be an emotional investor; be
    hands-off and automate deposits to ISAs to ensure you are saving
    adequate amounts
