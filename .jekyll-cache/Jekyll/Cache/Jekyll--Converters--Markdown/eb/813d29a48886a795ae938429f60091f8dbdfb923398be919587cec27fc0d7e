  </li>
  <li>A framework for understanding, measuring and improving EQ
    <ul>
      <li><strong>People high in self awareness understand what they do, what motivates and satisfies them, and which people and situations push their buttons</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Self management is the ability to use your awareness to stay flexible and direct your behaviour positively</strong>. This involves your ability to put immediate needs aside for long-term goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Awareness is the ability to recognise emotions in other people and understand what is <em>really</em> happening in a situation</strong>. Rather than thinking about what you’re going to say next, instead keenly observe and aim to understand human behaviour.</li>
      <li><strong>Relationship management involves using your awareness of your emotions to successfully manage your interactions</strong></li>
    </ul>
