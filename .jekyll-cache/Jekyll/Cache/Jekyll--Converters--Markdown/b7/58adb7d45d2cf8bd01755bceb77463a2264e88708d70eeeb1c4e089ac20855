<ol>
  <li>Ignorance
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of understanding</li>
      <li>These days, science and technology has progressed to the point where
this is rarely the problem</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ineptitude
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding exists, but isnâ€™t applied correctly</li>
      <li>For example, in medicine, failure of care is often caused by
inefficient completion, or mistakes in the many tasks involved in
diagnosis and treatment; Â½ of heart attack patients donâ€™t get
treatment on time</li>
      <li>In other industries, administrative errors can have significant
compliance and regulatory consequences</li>
      <li>Itâ€™s this which we want to tackle</li>
      <li><strong>Knowledge, training and experience is usually not the problem, but
avoidable failures are common because the task exceeds our
capability to carry it out correctly, safely and reliably</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
