    <ul>
      <li>Clarify the idea in your own mind</li>
      <li>Can be created instantly, without the need for technology</li>
      <li>Can be shared in an open way which invites comments and inspires
discussion</li>
      <li>Speaking directly from the picture avoids the need for relying on
notes, bullet points or a script</li>
      <li>Any problem can be made clearer with a picture, and any picture can
be created using the same set of tools and rules</li>
    </ul>

<h1 id="which-problems-which-pictures-and-who-is-we">Which problems? Which pictures? And who is we?</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Six types of problems
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Who and what</strong> problems – challenges that relate
to things, people and roles</li>
      <li><strong>How much</strong> problems – challenges that involve measuring and
counting</li>
      <li><strong>When</strong> problems – challenges that relate to scheduling and timing</li>
      <li><strong>Where</strong> problems – challenges that relate to direction and how
things fit together</li>
      <li><strong>How</strong> problems – challenges that relate to how things influence
one another</li>
      <li><strong>Why</strong> problems – challenges that relate to seeing the bigger
picture</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why hand-drawn pictures are great
    <ul>
      <li><strong>People like seeing other people’s pictures</strong> – especially
hand-drawn images as their spontaneity and roughness make them less
intimidating and more inviting; also, being able to see a concept
drawn out step-by-step is clearer</li>
      <li><strong>Hand-drawn images are quick to create and easy to change</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Computers make it too easy to draw the wrong thing</strong> – by forcing
us into using generic formats and shapes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Who is involved?
    <ul>
      <li>All three types of people are useful
and important in the process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul>
      <li>The semi-passive process of taking in visual information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See – selecting and clumping
    <ul>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Imagine – seeing what isn’t there
    <ul>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Show – making it all clear
    <ul>
      <li>…</li>
      <li></li>
