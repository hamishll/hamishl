  <li>Thinking about the future can be a source of worry
    <ul>
      <li>Humans are the only species to understand the concept of â€˜futureâ€™</li>
      <li>Children also donâ€™t understand the concept of â€˜futureâ€™ early on</li>
      <li>The frontal lobe is where we conceive the future and plan things.</li>
      <li>People with damage to the frontal lobe (perhaps from a lobotomy) are generally free from anxiety</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Lacking a feeling of control can be a source of worry

      <li>We determine value by comparison of one thing with another</li>
      <li>There is more than one kind of comparison we can make in any given instance</li>
      <li>Therefore, we may value something more highly when making a different kind of comparison</li>
      <li>This technique is used by sales people:
        <ul>
          <li>giving you an array of choices so you compare them instead of comparing whether you benefit from having the item</li>
          <li>showing you extremely bad, or extremely overpriced options, so the others seem great value by comparison</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>We fear loss more than gains - A majority of people would turn down a 85%/15% chance bet at doubling/losing their life savings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
