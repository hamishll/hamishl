# Introduction

## (Work) Lessons Learnt from India

1. Ensuring you have the correct roles and the correct people in those roles is the best way to have an effective team
- It sounds obvious, but if sourcing candidates is an issue, it can be tempting to fill the role with someone you know doesn't fit and tell yourself you will compensate somehow
- Have an **org chart** and update it frequently to avoid imbalanced structures forming, such as delivery pods which had a poor lead:developer ratio

2. Attrition has been a significant issue. Talent can be kept with:
- i) better compensation (largely outside of UK control) 
- ii) ensuring the team feels valued and happy (within my control)


### Actions
- Read Work Rules (Bock) to develop a better view of growing and keeping talent in teams
- Identify talent within the team sooner, and be more proactive and have a coherent strategy for giving new responsibility (that manages expectaction for developer to deliver in X weeks)
