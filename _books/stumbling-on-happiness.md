1.	Thinking about the future can be a source of worry
-	Humans are the only species to understand the concept of 'future'
-	Children also don't understand the concept of 'future' early on
-	The frontal lobe is where we conceive the future and plan things. 
-	People with damage to the frontal lobe (perhaps from a lobotomy) are generally free from anxiety

2.	Lacking a feeling of control can be a source of worry
