# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
Sleeping for less than 8 hours a night can have serious implications for many different aspects of health. Having good quality, efficient sleep:
 <br/> - improves memory
 <br/> - increases creativity
 <br/> - reduces chance of injury
 <br/> - increases testosterone and HGH
 <br/> - reduces cravings
 <br/> - reduces weight loss from lean muscle
 <br/> - reduces risk of catching illness
 <br/> - protects against cancer
 <br/> - protects against dementia
 <br/> - lowers risk of heart attack and stroke
 <br/> - makes you look more attractive
 <br/> - improves mood
 <br/> - reduces depression and anxiety

If sleep were a new prescription drug, people would pay thousands for it, but sleep is *free*

# Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep
1. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. If there is one piece of advice you follow, it should be this.
2. Exercise, but not later than 2-3 hours before your bedtime.
3. Avoid caffeine, it can take as long as eight hours to wear off fully.
4. Avoid alcohol before bed.
5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. Drinking too many fluids at night can cause frequent awakenings.
6. Avoid medecines that disrupt your sleep.
7. Don't nap after 3pm.
8. Relax before bed - read.
9. Take a hot bath before bed.
10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.
11. Daylight is key to regulating sleep patterns.
12. Don't lie in bed awake - if sleep doesn't reach you within 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing for a while.

# Part 1: About Sleep - Factors that affect sleep

1. Circadian Rhythm
 - is on average 24hrs 15m
 - is independent to external stimuli, but can be tuned by sunlight to run on 24hr
 - influences processes that control sleepiness, such as body temperature
 - the profile of body temperature can skew in “morning types” vs “evening types”, so forcing evening types into an early-bird schedule can result in long-term sleep deprivation

2. Melatonin
 - Released at night (when dark)
 - Makes you feel sleepy
 - Peaks around 1AM

3. Adenosine (“sleep pressure”)
 - Adenosine builds up during waking hours and decays during sleep
 - Caffeine latches onto adenosine welcome sites in the brain, preventing adenosine from doing so

All of these factors combine to give us a profile of wakefulness:

1. Characteristics of sleep
 - Motor and sensory signals are blocked by the thalamus during sleep
 - Sleep Phases:
￼
 - Approximately 90 minute cycles
 - Both NREM and REM are equally important, but for the different functions they perform 
 - During REM sleep, real events are replayed, at 25-50% real speed
 - the first half of the night is majority NREM sleep
 - the second half of the night is majority REM sleep
 - Sleeping six hours instead of eight means you lose 25% of your total sleep, but 60-90% of your REM sleep
 - This works the other way round as well - if you go to bed two hours later, you lose most of your NREM sleep

2. Frequencies and Waves
￼
 - NREM
 - During NREM, brain cells fire in-sync with each other and constructive interference creates these deep, broad waves
 - Analogous to FM vs AM, AM is lower frequency and travels further as a result
 - These slow, synchronous waves allow communication between distant regions of the brain * check the science here
 - This allows us to move memories from short-term to long-term storage
 - REM
 - Whereas NREM is all about storage, REM is all about integrating memories into our model of the world
 - We experience vivid hallucinations, with ideas and experiences melding and forming links between related concepts
 - During REM sleep, the muscles of the body are ‘cut-off’ from the brain stem, preventing us from potentially disastrous repercussions of our dreams   

3. Origins of Sleep
 - Worms that emerged 500 million years ago exhibit sleeping behaviour
 - Going even further back, unicellular organisms also rest according to the day/night cycle
 - Some animals barely sleep - giraffes and elephants get 4 hours
 - Some animals sleep loads - tigers, bats, possums get 15-19 hours
 - There’s no clear rule, but diet, metabolism, and social structures can be indicative
 - Generally a higher metabolic rate requires more ‘clean-up’ through sleep

4. Dreaming
 - Only birds and mammals have proper REM sleep
 - Partially aquatic mammals can’t enter REM sleep when on sea as the muscle paralysis would cause them to drown, so they subsist on a snooze diet of NREM sleep
 - If sleep deprived, the body will rebound into extra NREM on the first night sleeping, and then favour extra REM on subsequent nights
 - Note we can never properly “sleep back” the sleep we have lost 
 - Whilst we don’t have split-brains like birds or dolphins, when sleeping in unfamiliar environments, one half of the brain won’t sleep as deep as the other

5. Monophasic or Biphasic sleep?
 - All humans have a hardwired dip in alertness in the mid-afternoon hours
 - Napping has been a part of many cultures historically 
 - In a study that followed the abandoning of siesta culture in Spain showed that those who gave up siestas suffered a 37% great chance of CHD
 - Biphasic sleep appears to be a healthy habit

6. Us vs primates
 - Primates sleep markedly longer, 10-15 hrs
 - However we spend 25% of our sleep in REM whilst primates spend 9%
 - Sleeping on the ground allowed us to grab more REM sleep, as we didn’t have to worry about falling out of trees from REM’s paralysing effects

## Changes in the type of sleep as we age

1. Pre-birth: (NREM/REM is 50/50 in infancy)
 - REM peaks in the last week before birth, at 12 hours per day!
 - Autistic individuals have ~40% less REM sleep. Depriving infant rats of REM sleep causes symptoms similar to autism.
 - Alcohol also prevents REM sleep, so expecting mothers who drink also inflict less REM sleep on their unborn child, around 25% less
 - Breathing rate of the fetus can drop from 381 beats per hour to just 4 beats per hour
2. Childhood (NREM/REM is 70/30 age 5)
 - Children's rhythms run on an earlier schedule
3. Adolescence (NREM/REM is 80/20 in adulthood)
 - Increased proportion of NREM during adolescence leads to brain matuation. In particular, the frontal lobe, associated with rational decision-making is one of last regions to develop. 
 - Disrupting NREM in trials resulted in delayed brain mauration
 During puberty, th circadian rhythm shifts to later, much to the frustration of parents - **asking your teenage child to go to sleep at 10pm is the equivalent of asking you to go to sleep at 7 or 8 pm**
4. Older age
  - Older adults still need as much sleep, but for various reasons aren't able to obtain the level of sleep they require
  - By the time we reach 70, we'll have lost 80% of your NREM sleep
  - Most elderly individuals fail to connect their deteriorating health with their deterioration in sleep
  - A lower level of *sleep efficiency* (the proportion of time you were asleep when in bed) increases mortality risk.
  - Sleep disruption is a casual factor contributing to dementia
  - Older adults often want to stay awake later but an earlier circadian rhythm can cause them to end up napping in the early-evening which makes it hard to fall asleep at night gets them into a sleep debt cycle, being awoken early by their early circadian rhythm.
  - Brain deterioration is what causes this inability to generate deep sleep. Beta-amyloid, a key cause of Alzheimer's, is flushed away 10-20x faster during NREM.
  - Treating sleep disorders has been tentatively shown to reduce Alzheimers.

## Benefits of sleep for the brain
Sleep improves your mental and physical health, protects you from disease, and even makes you fitter and look more attractive. If sleep were a new prescription drug, people would pay thousands for it, but sleep is *free*.
- Shakespeare once said sleep is *"the chief nourisher in life's feast"*

1. Benefits on learning
- Those who napped in one study had a 20% learning advantage
- Sleeping, in particular NREM sleep with lots of spindles, moves memories to long-term storage, allowing more learning to continue
- Researchers have been able to boost the amplitude of spindles with electrodes, and even by playing tones at the same frequency of these spindles - showing a 40% memory enhancement.
- Practice makes perfect: in particular, practice, followed by sleep is a great way to improve performance. For example, sleeping after learning a piece of piano music can lead to significantly better performance.
2. Benefits on sports performance
- Usain Bolt has been known to nap hours before breaking world records.
- Sleep also lowers the risk of sports injury significantly [image]
- Similarly positive stats can be shown for NBA players

## Dangers of inadequate sleep
1. Every hour, someone in the US dies in a fatigue-related traffic accident
 - Momentary, total lapses in concentration, called microsleeps, are usually suffered by individals who are chronically sleep restricted.
 - 4 hours of sleep for six nights leads to as bad performance as being 24-hour sleep deprived
 - **6 hours of sleep for ten nights leads to as bad performance as being 24-hour sleep deprived**
 - Being awake for 19 hours leads to as poor performance as people who were legally drunk [image]
  - More dangerous are drowsy truckers. 80% are overweight and 50% are obese, leading to much higher risk of sleep apnea, and chronic sleep deprivation as a result.
  - This leads to a 200-500% greater likelihood of being involved in a traffic acccident, and **when truckers lose their life in a crash, they will on average take 4.5 other lives with them.**
2. Emotional irrationality
 - Sleep-deprived individuals show a 60% amplification in emotional reactivity
 - The *striatum*, associated with impulsivity and reward, become hyperactive as well
 - Insufficient sleep increases suicidal thoughts and determines the relapse rates of numerous addiction disorders
 - *"The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night's sleep"* - E. Joseph Cossman
3. Cancers and Heart Disease
 - 20 large-scale studies on sleep have tracked millions of people and all found the same conclusion - the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.
 - Shorter sleep is assoiated with 45% greater risk of CHD, and sleeping under six hours gives a 400% greater risk of cardiac arrest.
 - One night of mad sleep increases blood pressure - **when clocks change in March, we lose one hour of sleep opportunity, which results in a frightening spike in heart attacks**. This works in reverse as well - thee are fewer heart attacks after we gain an hour in Autumn.
 - Growth hormone is shut off when sleep deprived.
 4. Diabetes and Overeating
 - After a week of sleeping 4 hours a night, participants in a study were 40% less effective at absorbing glucose.
 - Ghrelin triggers a sense of hunger, and Leptim signals a sense of feeling full. These increase and decrease respectively when sleep deprived.
 - **Sleep-deprived individuals desired 600 more calories**
 - 70% of weight lost when sleep-deprived comes from lean body mass, along with a marked drop in testosterone.
 5. Appearance
 - Faces after one night of short sleep were rated as looking less healthy and significantly less attractive - reinforcing the idea of "beauty sleep"
 6. Illness
- Those who got five hours sleep had 50% chance of catching a cold
- Those who got seven hours sleep had 18% chance of catching a cold
- Similarly, response to vaccines are significantly reduced by lack of sleep.
