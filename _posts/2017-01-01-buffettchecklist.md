1.  Is the business simple and understandable?
1.  Does the business have a consistent operating history?
-   Buffett’s experience has been that the best returns are achieved by
    companies that have been producing the same product or service for
    several years
1.  Does the business have favourable long-term prospects?
-   Buffett sees the economic world as being divided into franchises and
    commodity businesses
-   Look to invest in franchise businesses – companies that provide a
    product that is *needed*, has *no close substitute*, and is *not
    regulated*
1.  Is management rational with its capital?
-   When a company generates cash, it has three options: (1) continue to
    build up cash, (2) reinvest to buy growth or (3) return money to
    shareholders
-   Buffett is of the opinion that only rational option is (3), to
    return money to shareholders by raising the dividend or by buying
    back shares
1.  Is management candid with shareholders?
-   Reporting of sufficient financial data, with no intent to mislead
1.  Does management resist the institutional imperative?
1.  Is the focus on Return on Equity?
1.  What is the rate of “owner earnings”?
-   This is EBIT minus capital expenditure
1.  Is there a high profit margin?
-   In Buffett’s experience, managers of high-cost operations
    continually add to overhead, whereas managers of low-cost operations
    are always finding ways to cut expenses
1.  Has the company created at least one dollar of market value for every dollar retained?
1.  What is the value of the business
1.  Can it be purchased at a significant discount to its value
