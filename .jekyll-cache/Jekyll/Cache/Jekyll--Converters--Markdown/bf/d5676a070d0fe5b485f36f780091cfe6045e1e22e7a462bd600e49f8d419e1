I"ô<h1 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h1>

<p class="nutshell">We think we are logical when we make decisions, but in reality we are all biased. Understanding this bias allows us to counter it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The truth about relativity
    <ul>
      <li>Given several choices, we often donâ€™t consider the absolute value, but make choices based on relative characteristics.</li>
      <li>For example, given the choices of house below people are most likely to pick the second option, as it is relatively comparable to the third.</li>
      <li>Contemporary â€¦ Colonial â€¦ Colonial with damaged roof for lower price</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The high price of ownership
    <ul>
      <li>We also have a fear of loss, and overvalue what we have.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The cost of â€˜FREEâ€™
    <ul>
      <li>The concept of something being â€˜FREE!â€™ can also make us behave irrationally, even if the saved value is minimal relative to other costs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Money vs Motivation
    <ul>
      <li>People will do things for free, if they see the decision as â€˜moralâ€™. If you offer a financial incentives, this â€˜moralityâ€™ driving force is lost, so might actually make people less likely to do things (if the financial reward is low).</li>
      <li>This concept explains why modern organisations are seeking to align their business goals with good causes; having a purpose larger than oneself is a big driver.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The influence of arousal
    <ul>
      <li>Emotions affect our our decision-making, an effect often used by advertisers. When aroused, our ability to distinguish between right and wrong becomes poorer.</li>
      <li><em>Expectations</em> hugely influence our experience. People can be â€˜primedâ€™; for example whiskey in a heavier glass tastes better. If primed with various words before doing something, we are more likely to experience or display characteristics related to those words.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The power of price
    <ul>
      <li>This describes how a high price tag automatically makes us assume something is better. The price of medicines affects how strong a placebo effect is experienced, which is why Nurofen might feel more potent than ibuprofen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
