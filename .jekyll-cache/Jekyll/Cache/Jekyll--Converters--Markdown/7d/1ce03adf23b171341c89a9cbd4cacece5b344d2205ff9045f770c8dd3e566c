    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does the business have favourable long-term prospects?
    <ul>
      <li>Buffett sees the economic world as being divided into franchises and
commodity businesses</li>
      <li>Look to invest in franchise businesses ‚Äì companies that provide a
product that is <em>needed</em>, has <em>no close substitute</em>, and is <em>not

  </li>

build up cash, (2) reinvest to buy growth or (3) return money to

return money to shareholders by raising the dividend or by buying
back shares</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

continually add to overhead, whereas managers of low-cost operations
are always finding ways to cut expenses</li>
    </ul>
