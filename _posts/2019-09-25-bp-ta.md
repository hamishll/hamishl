# Virtualisation

1. Hypervisors (ESX)
   - type I: good because runs directly on hardware (VMWare vSphere, XenServer, MS Hyper-V, KVM)
   - type II: guests share resources (VMware Fusion, VirtualBox)
   - **ESX 3.5 is incompatible with Windows 7**
   - RAM should not be shared
   - vCPU not necessarily as high-performing as pCPU
   - Use VMWare High Availability (HA) or equivalent

2. Suitability for virtualisation of each component
   - Database: NO!
   - App Server: Yes!
   - Runtime Resource: Yes! virtualise to ensure availability
   - Interactive Clients: Yes! should be identical to RR

3. Runtime Resources
   - Consistency: virtualisation ensures common build which negates environment differences
   - Security: hypervisor can be used to restrict users who can access
   - Control: virtualising allows you to scale up flexibly

4. Interactive Clients
   - Consistency: virtualisation ensures common build which negates environment differences
   - Control: virtualising allows you to scale up flexibly
   - Network: virtualising ensures client close to network, **which results in improved performance, especially for geographically separated Controllers**

5. User Environment Managers (UEM)
   - tools available which allow retention of user settings such as VMWare UE Manager

## Virtualisation Choices

1. Persistent VDI / HVD [Citrix XenDesktop (persistent), VMWare Horizon View (dedicated)]
   - `IC Yes, RR, Yes, LA !`
   - image persistent and user settings retained
   - Most suitable choice for RR and IC however consider patching and maintenance overhead
   - _Characteristics:_
     - **_OS Image is not refreshed_**
     - **_User assigned same VM on logon_**
     - _User personalisation settings retained_

2. Non-Persistent VDI / HVD [Citrix XenDesktop (non-persistent), VMWare Horizon View (floating)]
   - `IC !, RR !, LA !`
   - VM loaded from master image on each boot, usually coupled with a UEM
   - Consider how to maintain config changes, refresh of image may cause issues
   - _Characteristics:_
     - **_OS image may be refreshed on boot / scheduled basis_**
     - **_User is not guaranteed to be allocated same VM each time_**
     - _User Personalisation is lost unless coupled with UEM_
     - _Use of Login Agent is required_
     - **_Login Agent only support on XenDesktop 7.6+_**
     - **_Processes can hang using XenDesktop, as Citrix uses "hooking" which can cause deadlocks_**, resolve by changing registry

3. Hosted Shared Desktop (HSD) or Presentation Virtualisation [Microsoft RDSH and Citrix XenApp]
   - `IC !, RR No, LA No`
   - **xenapp good for rr ? --> NO**
   - Q: microsoft virtualizaion together with xenapp what are the caracteristic
   - Q: which virtualizations need always surface automation A: Hosted Shared
   - User presented with desktop and "published" applications
   - resources are shared between all users
   - **applications streamed, which limits automation techniques to Surface Automation**
     Desktop / Presentation Virtualisation
   - not suitable for Runtime Resource or Login Agent
   - IC can't be published application
   - _Characteristics:_
     - **_User is allocated a "published" desktop or application from multi-tenant server_**
     - **_System resources are shared_**
     - _Sessions are not persistent_

4. Application Virtualisation and Layering [Citrix XenApp, VMWare App Volumes, Thinapp]
   - `IC !, RR !, LA !`
   - Application Layering where the applications are no longer isolated from each other (unlike 3.)
   - applications streamed to user
   - decoupling application from underlying OS and any dependencies on registry and file system
   - care taken to check if application behaves same way as if installed on local machine, it might not!
   - _Characteristics:_
     - _Application / User personalisation is isolated from core image of VM, generally coupled with non-persistent VM_
     - _Application and UEM generally delivered via separate technologies_
   - Consider how developers will share resources
   - **Consider how RR will be started after a reboot - generally you would have to make these applications part of th base OS image**
   - Consider how user customisations required for a process will be delivered

- Minimal citrix esx version and problem with login agent --> 3.5
- learn exactly virtualization name provider with vdi persisten and not and characteristic
- what happen when using virtualization hsd /presentatoin and when using layering

# Communications and Encryption

<!--
|===Communication===|=====Purpose====== |===Type=== | =====Encryption=============|
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| IC -> AS         | Operating comms   | WCF       | Native, dependent on AD |
| AS -> RR         | Operating comms   | WCF       | Native, dependent on AD |
| AS -> RR         | Instructions      | TCP       | Certificates (opt)      |
| IC -> RR         | Instructions      | TCP       | Certificates (opt)      |
| AS -> DB         | Write to DB       | TCP       | Certificates (opt)      |
| RR -> Bus Apps   | Process operations| Various   | Various                 |
| User -> IC       | Controllers       | Various   | Various                 |
-->

1. TCP
   - used to give instructions (which is followed by WCF communication between RR and AS)
   - can be secured with certificates, ensuring common name matches (or appropriate wildcard)
   - uses _Origin Authentication_ and/or _Session Authentication_ which generates a single-use token

2. WCF
   - used for operating communications, such as seeing status and retrieving process to be ran
   - encrypted natively, security dependent on AD
   - App Server and RR must be configured to `Use Secure Connection`
   - Legacy installations can use .NET remoting instead of WCF, where security is handled by Microsoft's SSPI
   - Types:
     - WCF: SOAP with Message Encryption and Windows Authentication (encypts, supports SSO and /user)
     - WCF: SOAP with Transport Encryption and Windows Authentication (requires certificate!)
     - WCF: SOAP with Transport Encryption (only supports /user, requires certificate!)
     - .NET Remoting Secure (both /user and SSO)
     - WCF Insecure (not recommeded)
     - Cheatsheet:
     - `Windows Authentication allows SSO`
     - `Encyption means encryption`
     - `Transport encryption requires certificate`

1) Default ports:
   - App Server listens for TCP traffic on 8199
   - Runtime Resource listens for TCP traffic on 8181

2) Enforcing certificates and authentication
   - Enforce certificates by selecting `Require secure inbound instructional connections`
   - Require user login or SSO by disabling `Allow anonymous public Runtime Resources`

- how many types of wcf

- how to design network and connectivity and remote control
- characteristics connections which use remote

# Name Resolution

1. Short name used by default, but can also use FQDN (fully qualified domain name). Options:
   - Register and communicate using machine (short) name
   - Register using machine (short) name, communicate using FQDN
   - Register and communicate using FQDN

# Encryption schema

- study in detail - where can be the key saved - app server use it - recommended setup

- encryption key and config file uses
- encryption schema when, how is used and where can be saved?
- all table about encryption and sso and port

# Certificates

- To require certificates for DB, use `TrustServerCertificate=true, Encrypt=true`
- Certificates setup in login agent in config file?
- when to exactly use ssl
- I have to tell to what file when connecting using ssl --> **Thumbprint?**
- ipsx ? secure ip --> **Yeah you can**

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Active Directory

1. Benefits
- A common AD network allows native encryption of Blue Prism communications
- Access rights can be managed centrally across groups of users
- User access can be configured to use SSO

1. Benefits of AD for Runtime Resources
- Enforces security policies
- Enfocres GPO policies
- Provides auditability
- Simplifies access

## Process for AD

1. Select to use AD authentication when creating your database through the wizard
- You will need to select the Domain to be used
- You will need to select the Security Groups to be used

2. Configure the AD Security Groups
- eg: Devs, Testers, Release Managers, Controllers

3. Associate each Blue Prism role with each AD Security Group
- eg: Devs, Testers, Release Managers, Controllers

## Questions:

- **what happen with rr outside of active directory --> can't connect unless provide /user or /sso?**
- active directory provide data or communication encryption? by default? **Yes**
- **domain controller and forest AD, will RR be able to connect ? -> yes but not authenticate**

# SSO

- what happen to communications when using sso --> Encrypted?
- what give to Blue Prism when using sso? **/sso**

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Provisioning a Database

1. Guidance
   - Set appropriate initial file sizes
   - Set appropriate growth limits
   - Enable Instant File Initializations
   - Turn off auto-shrink
   - Turn on auto-growth

2. Roles
   - Requires `datareader` and `datawriter`
   - All blue prism permissions prefixed with "bpa\_", eg: `bpa_ExecuteSP_DataSource_bpSystem`
   - Creating, Configuring and Upgrading database permissions are not defined by blue prism. The following roles are required by your DBA, with `sysadmin` or:
   - `dbowner` and `dbcreator` = Create Database
   - `dbowner` = Configure Database
   - `dbowner` = Upgrade Database

3. Virtualisation
   - Typically not appropriate, as resources are usually contended for

4. Communications
- **Database should be near to App Server as latency is critical due to volume of operations**
- High latency allowed to and from Runtime Resources, owever this would reduce performance if performing frequent read/writes

# Maintaining a Database

1. Avoid Shrink Operations
   - as may cause fragmentation

2. Backups
   - Blue Prism supports both _Simple_ and _Full_ SQL recovery
   - If using _Full_, take regular transaction log backups to provide free space within the log files

3. General Maintenance should be used to manage:
   - available disk space
   - disk fragmentation which may reduce performance, use **ALTER INDEX** to rebuild
   - paging file should be appropriately sized
   - event viewer should be checked for errors
   - verify backups to ensure they have been completed without error
   - verify data integrity with **DBCC CHECKDB**
   - ensure statistics up-to-date by turning on **Auto Create Statistics** and **Auto Update Statistics**

4. In-product maintenance
   - Archiving can be scheduled within product
   - Command line can be used instead:
     - SSO: `AutomateC.exe /archive /sso /age 3m`
     - Native: `AutomateC.exe /archive /user "user""pass" /age 3m`
     - optionally add `/delete`

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Remote Access Tools (RDP)

1. Not suitable as:
   - the OS is aware it is being connected to, which can interrupt operations
   - when a user authenticates it disconnects other users

# Load Balancing

1. Health Monitoring
   - **Simple Monitoring** - pinging the host
   - **Active Monitoring** - HTTP(s) endpoint that publishes the health of the service `https://bpserver001:8199/bpserver`
   - **Passive Monitoring** - occurs as part of a client request, checking health based on # connection attempts within a time period. Receiving a bad response marks as unavailable

2. Load Balancing Algorithms
   - **Round Robin** (allocates cyclically)
   - **Weighted Round Robin** (if server A has more capacity, you can allow it to take on higher proportion of connections)
   - **Least Connection** (will allocate based on least **current** connections)
   - **Weighted Least Connection** (if server A has more capacity, you can allow it to take on higher proportion of connections)
   - **Random**

3. Types of Load Balancing
   - **Layer 4**: acts upon TCP, IP, UDP, FTP
   - **Layer 7**: acts upon application protocols such as HTTP - more advanced features

4. Other stuff
   - Stickiness can be used to ensure resources stay connected to the same server
   - WCF is like internet traffic - the channel doesn't have to be held open, and the sessions are persisted on the app server instead
   - SSL Certificate on app server should be applicable to the Load Balancer

5. Load Balancing HTTPS Connections
   - SSL Passthrough = supported (no decryption at the LB)
   - SSL Termination = supported (connection terminated at LB, decrypted, re-encrypted and new connection establised)
   - SSL Offboarding = not supported (same as termination with no decrpytion)

6. Pooling
   - Single pool gives flexibility
   - Multiple pools allow maintenance to be more separated and offers more redundancy, however risk

# App Server and Login Agent
- app server and login agent config file

# Login Agent

1. Mandatory Security Policies
- Do not require CTRL + ALT + DEL
- Do not require accepting on-screen message
- Do not require a lock screen

2. Installation
- Specify Connection Name, i.e. 'BluePrism-Production'
- Require SSO or User arguments if anonymous logins are disabled
- Config file can have arguments:
-      port: 8181
-      sslcert: {Thumbprint}
-      user: {username}, {password}
-      sso
- Add RR to Startup so handover occurs once logged in, or use Windows Task Scheduler
- Retrieve credential _Windows Logoi: HOSTNAME_
- Trigger Login Agent in schedules

# Credential Manager

1. Recommendations for environment:
   - encryption configured with a Key
   - Configure app servers to store the Key within separate files and restrict access to this file to the logged in service account
   - Recommend storing Key on app server, not database
   - All clients connect via an app server
   - Use SSO
   - Encrypt between app server and database with certificates
   - Recommend encryption occurs between client and app server, not app server to database

# Disaster Recovery

1. A
   - Each app server must be configured with identical encryption schemes
   - Any cases being worked at time of failure will be marked as exception
   - Must be up-to-date replication of database through a heartbeat to maintain state of cases
   - Active/Passive (Site A/B): network names of RRs must match for both Site A and Site B
   - Active/Active (Site A/B): ensure app server at Site B has low latency

   - 1x Intel Xeon Quad Core
   - 32GB RAM
   - 70GB OS
   - 420GB SDD

# Questions:

1. What should be considered when configuring high availability and disaster recovery scenarios for availability of Business Processes managed by Blue Prism? (Select 2)

- [CORRECT] Resource pools and Active Queues can be used to distribute work to Runtime Resources which are online
- [CORRECT] Using a load balancer and 2 application servers will ensure high availability of an automated process
- [WRONG] The Runtime Resources are "stateful” devices, therefore any failure or maintenance event should also be taken into account in the process design and scheduling methodology
- [WRONG] Use the setting within a Blue Prism Process to force a process to fail over to an alternative Runtime Resource in the event of a failure
