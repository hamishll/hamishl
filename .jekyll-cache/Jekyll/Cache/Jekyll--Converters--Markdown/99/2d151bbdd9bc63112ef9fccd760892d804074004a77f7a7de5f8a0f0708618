<h1 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h1>

<p class="nutshell">We are driven by three main drivers: Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. Give people self-direction, the opportunity to master their skill and work towards a transcendant purpose that is <em>good</em>.</p>

<h1 id="the-problem-with-extrinsic-motivators">The problem with extrinsic motivators</h1>

<ol>
  <li>When tasks require cognition, financial rewards for performance are not effective
    <ul>
      <li>In mechanical tasks, rewarding based on results improves performance</li>
      <li>However, those offered high financial reward for cognitive tasks <em>performed worse</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For most workplace tasks, extrinsic motivators (financial bonuses):
    <ul>
      <li>are only effective short-term</li>
      <li>promote short-term thinking which is damaging in the long-term</li>
      <li>distract from intrinsic motivators (such as purpose)</li>
      <li>can stifle creativity</li>
      <li>encourage shortcuts and unethical behaviour</li>
      <li>can become addictive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="extrinsic-vs-intrinsic-driven-people">Extrinsic vs Intrinsic driven people</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Extrinsic people are driven by external factors - money, fame and status
    <ul>
      <li>They can be highly successful but be troubled by an insatiable appetite for more ‘stuff’</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Intrinsic people’s motivation comes from within - they want to accomplish something meaningful.
    <ul>
      <li>These people are driven by a desire for autonomy, mastery and purpose.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="drivers">Drivers</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Autonomy - “Our desire to direct our own lives”
    <ul>
      <li>This is contrary to traditional management strategies, which are great for compliance</li>
      <li>If you want <em>engagement</em>, self-direction is better</li>
      <li>Companies which give employees periods of free time to work on anything, find huge value in the output of these periods</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mastery - “The urge to get better at stuff”
    <ul>
      <li>We gain satisfaction from getting better at things</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Purpose
    <ul>
      <li>Believing in a purpose drives people to do complex work, for free</li>
      <li>Wikipedia and Linux are great examples of this</li>
      <li>Companies are increasingly focusing on transcendant purpose as a motivator</li>
      <li>If an organisation is focused on profit over purpose, bad quality products and services are delivered</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
