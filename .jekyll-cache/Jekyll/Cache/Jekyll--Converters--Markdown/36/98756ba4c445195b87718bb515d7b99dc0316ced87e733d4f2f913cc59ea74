I"<h1 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h1>

<p class="nutshell">Big theme of loss, grief, hopelessness, and hope. Both Naoko and Midori encounter loss but approach it in different ways (thatâ€™s not to say their losses are comparable or equal)
On a more positive note, itâ€™s a story of working out what you want and wrestling with decisions on what kind of love you want (deep slow Vs passionate), and how selfish/hedonistic one should be in trying to pursue happiness</p>

<ol>
  <li>Naoko
    <ul>
      <li>Regression into grief and hopelessness</li>
      <li>Existence in purgatory (the hostel) that makes it impossible to move on</li>
      <li>Her not wanting Watanabe to see her when she was unwell; a total loss of self confidence through hopelessness</li>
      <li>By the end of the book you see her as this haunted figure who was half-dead when Kizuki died</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Midori
    <ul>
      <li>Her coping strategy for grief is to distract and dive into life</li>
      <li>She talks tough even when she feels so strongly for Watanabe</li>
      <li>Itâ€™s a protection mechanism, but a way of looking at things that Iâ€™m more aligned to personally - people overvalue dwelling on sad events; distraction is a valid way to recover faster</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Watanabe
    <ul>
      <li>The loneliness during Spring is well written</li>
      <li>The way Murakami conveys his despair after Naokoâ€™s death is beautifully written in the saddest way</li>
      <li>Thereâ€™s this closure; a sense of relief once Naoko dies which you canâ€™t help but feel, and it feels almost wrong to feel that way</li>
      <li>Wasnâ€™t expecting the sleeping with Reiko part; is it a device for letting go of the intense feelings for Naokoâ€™s death that they both shared</li>
      <li>A character stuck between committing to someone heâ€™d committed his heart to, and the person who could make him happy; and this feeling of duty trumping his own desire for happiness - whatâ€™s right? To hurt the other or hurt yourself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
