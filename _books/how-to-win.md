# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
-   Technical knowledge
-   Ability to express ideas
-   Assume leadership
-   Arouse enthusiasm among people
-   Requires a deep, driving desire to increase your ability to deal
    with people
-   “My popularity, happiness and sense of worth depend upon my skill in
    dealing with people”
-   Ask yourself how to apply each suggestion, review, keep an
    ‘engagement journal’

# Fundamental techniques in handling people:

1.  Don’t criticise, condemn or complain
-   Doesn’t lead to lasting change and often incurs resentment
-   The person we condemn will try to justify themselves and condemn us
    in return
-   Instead try to understand their point of view
-   “Any fool can criticise and complain – and most fools do”
-   “But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and
    forgiving”
-   “A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men
1.  Give honest and sincere appreciation
-   “I am yet to find a person who did not do better work and put forth
    greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do
    under a spirit of criticism
-   All human beings hunger for appreciation
-   “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of
    him”
1.  Arouse in the other person an eager want
-   There is only one way to get anybody to do anything: by making them
    want to do it
-   “I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people to be
    the greatest asset I possess”
-   “If there is one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get
    the other person ‘s point of view and see things from that person’s
    angle as well as your own”

# Six ways to make people like you:

1.  Become genuinely interested in other people
1.  Smile
-   “That is why dogs are such a hit. They are so glad to see us that
    they almost jump out of their skins. So naturally, we are glad to
    see them.”
-   You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have
    a good time meeting you
-   Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself to. Act as if you were
    already happy. Feeling follows action more than we realise
-   “Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be” –
    Lincoln
-   The Value of a Smile at Christmas:
-   *“It costs nothing, but creates much.*
-   *It enriches those who receive it, without impoverishing those who
    give.*
-   *It happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever*
-   *None are so rich that they can get along without it*
-   *And none so poor but are richer for its benefits*
-   *It creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in business,
    and is the countersign of friends*
-   *It is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged*
-   *Sunshine to the sad and, and nature’s best antidote for trouble*
-   *Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen*
-   *For it is something that is no earthly good to somebody till it is
    given away”*
1.  A person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important
    sound in any language
2.  Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves
-   Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt
    attention
-   Ask questions the other person will enjoy answering
1.  Talk in terms of the other person’s interests
2.  Make the other person feel important – and do it sincerely
-   The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be
    appreciated
-   Do unto others as you would have others do unto you
-   Little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of
    everyday life
-   The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel
    themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their
    hearts is to let them realise in some subtle way that you realise
    their importance, and recognise it sincerely
-   Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours

# Win people to your way of thinking

1.  The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it
-   ‘In an argument, there are no winners’
-   “A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still”
-   “…he wanted a feeling of importance. As long as X argued with him he
    got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting his authority. But
    as soon as his importance was admitted and the argument stopped, he
    became a sympathetic and kindly human being”
1.  Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say ‘You’re
    wrong’
-   If you’re going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it
-   When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. If we are handled
    gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride
    in our frankness and broad-mindedness
1.  If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically
-   “…wanted a feeling of importance, so when I began to condemn myself
    the only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the
    magnanimous attitude of showing mercy”
1.  Begin in a friendly way
2.  Start by getting the other person saying ‘yes’, ‘yes’
3.  Let the other person do a great deal of the talking
-   Let the other person talk themselves out
-   They won’t pay attention to you while they still have a lot of ideas
    of their own crying out for expression
1.  Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers
-   Present a sketch of an idea, and ask if they could complete it
1.  Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view
-   Don’t condemn them, any fool can do that
-   Success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the
    other person’s viewpoint
-   Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you
    consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your
    own
-   Give the other person the purpose or direction of your conversation
1.  Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires
-   Most people you will ever meet are hungering for sympathy. Give it
    to them and they will love you
1.  Appeal to the nobler motives
-   “A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing; the one that
    sounds good and a real one”
1.  Dramatize your ideas
2.  Throw down a challenge
-   Give someone the chance to prove his or her worth

# Be a leader
1.  Begin with praise and honest appreciation
-   It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have
    heard some praise of our good points
1.  Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly
-   If following up a positive point with a negative point, replace
    ‘but’ with ‘and’
1.  Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person
-   It isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults
    if the person criticising begins by humbly admitting that he, too,
    is far from impeccable
1.  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders
2.  Let the other person save face
3.  Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement
-   Be ‘hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise’
1.  Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to
2.  Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct
3.  Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest
