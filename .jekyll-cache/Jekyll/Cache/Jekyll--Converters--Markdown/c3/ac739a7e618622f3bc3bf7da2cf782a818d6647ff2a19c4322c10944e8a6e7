<ol>
  <li>Collaboration requires good intentions and an unselfish attitude
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid the red zone – a place of defensiveness driven by
self-interest, and desire to outshine others</li>
      <li>Aim for the green zone – being focussed on cultivating successful,
long-term cooperation, with shared values and openness</li>
      <li>Be honest with yourself in evaluating how effectively you are
reaching the green zone, and be open to feedback from others</li>
      <li>One helpful exercise is to ask teammates for 10 words that describe
your attitude or style</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be truthful, using the ‘first truth first’ tool
    <ul>
      <li>This tool is a way to facilitate open and honest discussions about
problems the moment they arise</li>
      <li>It’s tempting to put-off facing problems for fear of creating
awkward situations, but it’s best to not let these problems develop</li>
      <li>Tackle the issue head-on, but in a non-judgemental, supportive and
honest way</li>
      <li>For example, you could say: <em>“we have an issue that isn’t easy to
talk about, but please be aware this doesn’t change how much we
value your contributions to the team”</em></li>
      <li>Make sure that your body language matches the intention of your
message</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Good listening skills are vital
    <ul>
      <li>If someone thinks you’re listening intently they will be more
willing to share and give more accurate information</li>
      <li>Have a tell-me-more attitude: give your full attention and they will
be more willing to open up</li>
      <li>Sincerely listen and don’t try to interrupt or cross-examine with
probing questions</li>
      <li>Use phrases like <em>“tell me more about that”</em> and <em>“oh really? please
go on”</em></li>
      <li>A good listener responds in ways that show the message has been
received and processed, with an appropriate emotional response</li>
      <li>Listen to body language cues as well</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Take responsibility for your actions
    <ul>
      <li>Remember that you have the power to make your own choices and
control your life</li>
      <li>Therefore, you also need to take responsibility and be accountable
for your actions</li>
      <li>If you make a mistake, admit it, and take action to fix it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be self-aware and work out where you fit in
    <ul>
      <li>Being self-aware means understanding your own fears and desires, and
how they differ from others</li>
      <li>These fears and desires affect three key traits: inclusion, control
and openness</li>
      <li>Ask yourself, <em>“how do my levels of inclusion, control and openness
compare to others I’m working with?”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Managing conflicts
    <ul>
      <li>Interest-based approach:</li>
      <li>1. Create an environment that makes everyone feel included</li>
      <li>2. Clearly understand the problem and issues at hand</li>
      <li>3. Understand everyone’s own interests, including your own</li>
      <li>4. Have a contingency plan as a frame of reference for the quality of
your target outcome</li>
      <li>5. To find a solution, break down issues to smaller problems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
