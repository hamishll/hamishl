# Why we fail

1.  Ignorance
-   Lack of understanding
-   These days, science and technology has progressed to the point where
    this is rarely the problem

1.  Ineptitude
-   Understanding exists, but isn’t applied correctly
-   For example, in medicine, failure of care is often caused by
    inefficient completion, or mistakes in the many tasks involved in
    diagnosis and treatment; ½ of heart attack patients don’t get
    treatment on time
-   In other industries, administrative errors can have significant
    compliance and regulatory consequences
-   It’s this which we want to tackle
-   **Knowledge, training and experience is usually not the problem, but
    avoidable failures are common because the task exceeds our
    capability to carry it out correctly, safely and reliably**

# The solution to ineptitude (human error) is checklists

1.  That’s basically it
-   No need to write a whole book about it xD
-   This book is pretty awful
