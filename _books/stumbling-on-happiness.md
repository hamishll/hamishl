# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
Text

1.	Thinking about the future can be a source of worry
-	Humans are the only species to understand the concept of 'future'
-	Children also don't understand the concept of 'future' early on
-	The frontal lobe is where we conceive the future and plan things. 
-	People with damage to the frontal lobe (perhaps from a lobotomy) are generally free from anxiety

2.	Lacking a feeling of control can be a source of worry


3.	Presentism
	- We determine value by comparison of one thing with another
	- There is more than one kind of comparison we can make in any given instance
	- Therefore, we may value something more highly when making a different kind of comparison
	- This technique is used by sales people: 
		- giving you an array of choices so you compare them instead of comparing whether you benefit from having the item
		- showing you extremely bad, or extremely overpriced options, so the others seem great value by comparison
	- We fear loss more than gains - A majority of people would turn down a 85%/15% chance bet at doubling/losing their life savings
