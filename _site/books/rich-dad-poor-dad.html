    <h1 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h1>

<p class="nutshell">Rich people don’t work for money, they make money work for them. Always
look to increase your assets and limit your liabilities. Become
financially literate and master your chosen market. Use your job to
learn whilst developing your assets separately.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The rich don’t work for money
    <ul>
      <li>“The poor and middle-class work for money. The rich have money work
for them”</li>
      <li>Most people want to feel secure financially, so passion doesn’t
direct them; fear does</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why teach financial literacy?
    <ul>
      <li>Most important rule: know the difference between an asset and a
liability</li>
      <li>Assets create income; liabilities create expenses</li>
      <li>Buying a house isn’t really an asset if you aren’t earning rent from
it or it requires a mortgage (…?)</li>
      <li>Making money isn’t nearly as important as how you spend it – as your
spending habits will scale with the amount you are making</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mind your own business
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t confuse your profession with your business (your asset column)</li>
      <li>Once you’ve assigned money to developing your asset column, never
take it out</li>
      <li>If you want to take on a liability, first buy an asset that
generates enough cash to cover it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Understanding tax law can give you an advantage
    <ul>
      <li>Corporations are very good at minimising the tax they pay</li>
      <li>Individuals are taxed <em>before</em> expenses, whereas corporations are
taxed <em>after</em> expenses</li>
      <li>If you hold assets in a corporation, you can legally write off
expenses such as holidays, memberships, meals etc.</li>
      <li>Study accounting, investing, economics and law. Understand markets
and investing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The rich invent money
    <ul>
      <li>Option 1: Work hard, pay taxes, save</li>
      <li>Option 2: Take time to develop your financial intelligence and use
your intelligence to create assets</li>
      <li>This means finding opportunities others have missed, know how to
raise money and organise smart people</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Work to learn – don’t work for money
    <ul>
      <li>“Seek work for what you will learn, not what you earn”, especially
if you are just starting out</li>
      <li>Learn to manage cash flow, systems and people</li>
      <li>Communication, sales and marketing skills are also important</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Overcoming obstacles
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fear:</strong> people who make money are not afraid of losing it; they
learn how to limit their losses and turn those losses into
opportunities</li>
      <li><strong>Cynicism:</strong> cynics will always have excuses for why something
isn’t possible</li>
      <li><strong>Laziness:</strong> usually the laziest people are the ones who are busy –
lazy people stay busy to avoid problems they don’t want to face</li>
      <li><strong>Bad habits:</strong> “pay yourself first” – take care of yourself
physically, mentally and financially – instead of your boss or
landlord</li>
      <li><strong>Arrogance:</strong> = ego + ignorance; the solution is educations,
specifically financial education</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How to get started
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Have a reason greater than reality:</strong> Know what you want to
achieve and when</li>
      <li><strong>Choose daily:</strong> every day and every dollar is a choice to be rich
or poor</li>
      <li><strong>Choose friends carefully:</strong> their mindset and behaviour will rub
off on you; find people who support you, teach you and make you a
better person</li>
      <li><strong>Master a market:</strong> find an area you are interested in and develop
mastery</li>
      <li><strong>Pay yourself first:</strong> look after your own physical, mental and
financial wellbeing before your employer’s</li>
      <li><strong>Assets buy luxuries:</strong> don’t buy a luxury until you have created
an asset that pays for it</li>
      <li><strong>Find heroes who inspire you:</strong> find investment heroes who make it
look easy and imitate them</li>
      <li><strong>Teach and you shall receive:</strong> the more you teach people, the more
you will learn</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some further to-dos
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stop doing what you’re doing:</strong> Take a break and think about what
is and isn’t working</li>
      <li><strong>Look for new ideas:</strong> read books on different subjects, especially
how-to books (eg: accounting, tax)</li>
      <li><strong>Find someone who has done what you want to do and ask for tips</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Take classes and study:</strong> take the time, put the effort in and
invest in your education</li>
      <li><strong>Make lots of offers to make great deals:</strong> rejection is part of
the process so get used to it</li>
      <li><strong>Learn from history and your mistakes</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Action always beats inaction:</strong> if you don’t know what to do, just
overcome your inertia and just keep moving</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
