# In a nutshell

1.  Collaboration requires good intentions and an unselfish attitude
-   Avoid the red zone – a place of defensiveness driven by
    self-interest, and desire to outshine others
-   Aim for the green zone – being focussed on cultivating successful,
    long-term cooperation, with shared values and openness
-   Be honest with yourself in evaluating how effectively you are
    reaching the green zone, and be open to feedback from others
-   One helpful exercise is to ask teammates for 10 words that describe
    your attitude or style

1.  Be truthful, using the ‘first truth first’ tool
-   This tool is a way to facilitate open and honest discussions about
    problems the moment they arise
-   It’s tempting to put-off facing problems for fear of creating
    awkward situations, but it’s best to not let these problems develop
-   Tackle the issue head-on, but in a non-judgemental, supportive and
    honest way
-   For example, you could say: *“we have an issue that isn’t easy to
    talk about, but please be aware this doesn’t change how much we
    value your contributions to the team”*
-   Make sure that your body language matches the intention of your
    message

1.  Good listening skills are vital
-   If someone thinks you’re listening intently they will be more
    willing to share and give more accurate information
-   Have a tell-me-more attitude: give your full attention and they will
    be more willing to open up
-   Sincerely listen and don’t try to interrupt or cross-examine with
    probing questions
-   Use phrases like *“tell me more about that”* and *“oh really? please
    go on”*
-   A good listener responds in ways that show the message has been
    received and processed, with an appropriate emotional response
-   Listen to body language cues as well

1.  Take responsibility for your actions
-   Remember that you have the power to make your own choices and
    control your life
-   Therefore, you also need to take responsibility and be accountable
    for your actions
-   If you make a mistake, admit it, and take action to fix it

1.  Be self-aware and work out where you fit in
-   Being self-aware means understanding your own fears and desires, and
    how they differ from others
-   These fears and desires affect three key traits: inclusion, control
    and openness
-   Ask yourself, *“how do my levels of inclusion, control and openness
    compare to others I’m working with?”*

1.  Managing conflicts
-   Interest-based approach:
-   1\. Create an environment that makes everyone feel included
-   2\. Clearly understand the problem and issues at hand
-   3\. Understand everyone’s own interests, including your own
-   4\. Have a contingency plan as a frame of reference for the quality of
    your target outcome
-   5\. To find a solution, break down issues to smaller problems
