<p class="nutshell">Saving early is essential for maximising growth. Equity markets have
consistently delivered the best returns, and investing in index fund
ETFs and international markets provide good growth and spread risk</p>

<ol>
  <li>Millennials aren’t investing their money
    <ul>
      <li>The 2001 and 2008 recessions have made millennials sceptical of
investing in equity markets</li>
      <li>However, stock markets have seen greater returns than all other
asset classes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Millennials’ greatest advantage is their youth
    <ul>
      <li>£1 invested in equities today could be worth £15 by retirement in 40
years</li>
      <li>If one waited 10 years to start investing, it would be worth only
£7.50 (30 years)</li>
      <li>This is the equivalent of 9.5%pa</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A recipe for investment
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Go global</strong> – many investors miss out on good opportunities by
only investing in domestic stocks. Developing countries have massive
growing consumer demand and untapped natural resources. Investing
globally also offers a hedge against a weakening domestic currency
(Brexit!)</li>
      <li><strong>Be different</strong> – buying index funds are a great way to begin and
ensures a broad portfolio</li>
      <li><strong>Get out of your own way</strong> – don’t be an emotional investor; be
hands-off and automate deposits to ISAs to ensure you are saving
adequate amounts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
