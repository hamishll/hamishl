# Introduction

1.  The merits of drawing
-   Clarify the idea in your own mind
-   Can be created instantly, without the need for technology
-   Can be shared in an open way which invites comments and inspires
    discussion
-   Speaking directly from the picture avoids the need for relying on
    notes, bullet points or a script
-   Any problem can be made clearer with a picture, and any picture can
    be created using the same set of tools and rules

# Which problems? Which pictures? And who is we?

1.  Six types of problems
-   **Who and what** problems – challenges that relate
    to things, people and roles
-   **How much** problems – challenges that involve measuring and
    counting
-   **When** problems – challenges that relate to scheduling and timing
-   **Where** problems – challenges that relate to direction and how
    things fit together
-   **How** problems – challenges that relate to how things influence
    one another
-   **Why** problems – challenges that relate to seeing the bigger
    picture

1.  Why hand-drawn pictures are great
-   **People like seeing other people’s pictures** – especially
    hand-drawn images as their spontaneity and roughness make them less
    intimidating and more inviting; also, being able to see a concept
    drawn out step-by-step is clearer
-   **Hand-drawn images are quick to create and easy to change**
-   **Computers make it too easy to draw the wrong thing** – by forcing
    us into using generic formats and shapes

1.  Who is involved?
-   All three types of people are useful
    and important in the process
