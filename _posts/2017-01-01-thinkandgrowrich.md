# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
Combine desire with faith to autosuggest achievements to your
subconscious mind. Have a specific mission statement and repeat it twice
daily. Successful people know their purpose, which makes them decisive
and persistent. Seek out others who share your desires and motivations;
the collective mind is powerful and they will inspire you to be better.
Make decisions promptly and confidently, but don’t be afraid to adapt
and change course if necessary.

1.  Desire: the starting point of all achievement
-   Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire
-   Determine exactly what you intend to give for this money
-   Establish a definite date by which you intend to acquire this money
-   Create a definite plan to acquire money, and take the first step
    immediately
-   Put the above four items into a clear, concise sentence describing
    each part
-   Read the statement aloud twice daily, in the morning and at night
-   **My statement:** *I want to have £1,000,000 by age 30, through
    saving money and investing in tech businesses. I’ll develop
    understanding in this area and find investment opportunities through
    my job.*

1.  Faith: visualisation of desire, and belief in attainment of desire
-   The subconscious mind must believe that something is possible in
    order for us to act on it
-   “Faith is a state of mind that may be induced by affirmation or
    repeated instructions to the subconscious mind”
-   By practice you can translate these desires into reality

1.  Autosuggestion: the way we influence the subconscious mind
-   Repeated visualisation will enforce your conscious behaviour
-   Repeat your mission statement aloud twice per day

1.  Specialised knowledge is critical for success
-   Mastery of a specific topic is required to earn money from it

1.  Imagination: the workshop of the mind
-   Synthetic imagination – rearranging existing ideas into new concepts
-   Creative imagination – creating something from nothing

1.  Organised planning: the crystallisation of desire into action
-   Create organised plans, and break goals down into smaller steps
-   Build a group of motivated and persistent people and meet with them
    regularly to keep progress on track

1.  Decision: the mastery of procrastination
-   One key problem of unsuccessful people is a lack of decision
-   Successful people make decisions promptly
-   The ability to decide quickly comes from knowing what it is you want
-   “The world has a habit of making room for the man whose words and
    actions show that he knows where he is going”

1.  Persistence: the sustained effort necessary to induce faith
-   Persistence is a state of mind that can be cultivated by having
    definiteness of purpose, desire, self-reliance, definiteness of
    plans, accurate knowledge, cooperation, willpower and habit

1.  Power of the master mind: the driving force
-   Having intelligent and experienced people around you gives a serious
    economic advantage
-   Think of the PayPal mafia, and other strong groups

1.  Sexual desire is a powerful driver
-   A bit weird, but there is truth to it
