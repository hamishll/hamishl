I"L<p>No notes for this one, would recommend as it’s a quick read.</p>

<p>One passage I loved was this one, with its use of the phrase “Great rumours of travel!”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Whenever her father was alone with a dog in a house he would lean over and smell the skin at the base of its paw. This he would say, as if coming away from a brandy snifter, is the greatest smell in the world! A bouquet! Great rumours of travel! She would pretend disgust, but the dog’s paw <em>was</em> a wonder: the smell of it never suggested dirt. It’s a cathedral!”</p>
