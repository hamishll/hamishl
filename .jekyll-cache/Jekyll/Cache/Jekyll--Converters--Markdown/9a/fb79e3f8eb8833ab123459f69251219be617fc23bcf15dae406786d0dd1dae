<p class="nutshell">Worry is a psychological effect which we can control. Cultivate a mental
attitude of peace and happiness, be yourself and don‚Äôt stress the little
things. Think ‚Äòwhat is the worst thing that could happen?‚Äô and accept
outcomes you can‚Äôt influence, including past events. Most worries come
from not knowing enough to make a decision; identify the root of the
problem and once you have decided what to do, <strong>act</strong> and be confident
in your decision. Keep busy, help others and you‚Äôll find a purpose to
drive you.</p>
