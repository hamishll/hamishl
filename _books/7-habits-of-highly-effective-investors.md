1.	Save early, and automatically
-	The earlier you start, the more compound interest works in your favour.

2.	Expect financial emergencies
-	Always have enough cash to cover emergencies, so you don't have to sell anything or require borrowing.

3.	Set an asset allocation, and diversify
-	Research by finance professors has shown that the majority of returns come from asset allocation, rather than picking the right security or the right time to invest.
-	As a general rule of thumb for deciding stock-bond allocation is that **your bond allocation should be equal to your age**, or a bit higher.
-	Avoid buying and selling individual securities. The person on the other side of the table knows more than you.

4.	Keep fees low
-	Paying lower fees and commission is a good way to improve your returns, guaranteed
-	Keeping investments simple keeps fees low. Consider indexing and ETFs. 
-	Avoid actively managed funds, which have higher fees. For example, Vanguard VFIAX has 0.05% fees.

5.	Get a fiduciary
-	Instead of a financial advisor who profits from selling you certain investment products

6. 	Spend less than you earn
-	Millenials and Gen Xers in particular commonly overspend.

7.	Maximise employee benefits
-	Maximise the matching on pension offered by company
-	Other perks such as health memberships and insurance should be utilised also.
