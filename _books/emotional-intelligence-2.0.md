1.	Defining emotional intelligence
-	*"Emotional Intelligence is your ability to recognise and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behaviour and relationships"*
-	EQ has zero correlation with IQ
-	EQ accounts for about 58% of performance in most jobs
-	People with high EQ earn ~Â£20,000 more than those with low EQ

2.	A framework for understanding, measuring and improving EQ
-	**People high in self awareness understand what they do, what motivates and satisfies them, and which people and situations push their buttons**
-	**Self management is the ability to use your awareness to stay flexible and direct your behaviour positively**. This involves your ability to put immediate needs aside for long-term goals.
-	**Social Awareness is the ability to recognise emotions in other people and understand what is *really* happening in a situation**. Rather than thinking about what you're going to say next, instead keenly observe and aim to understand human behaviour.
-	**Relationship management involves using your awareness of your emotions to successfully manage your interactions**
