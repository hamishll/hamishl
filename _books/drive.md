# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
We are driven by three main drivers: Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. Give people self-direction, the opportunity to master their skill and work towards a transcendant purpose that is *good*.

# The problem with extrinsic motivators

1.  When tasks require cognition, financial rewards for performance are not effective
-	In mechanical tasks, rewarding based on results improves performance
-	However, those offered high financial reward for cognitive tasks *performed worse*

2.	For most workplace tasks, extrinsic motivators (financial bonuses):
-	are only effective short-term
-	promote short-term thinking which is damaging in the long-term
-	distract from intrinsic motivators (such as purpose)
-	can stifle creativity
-	encourage shortcuts and unethical behaviour
-	can become addictive

# Extrinsic vs Intrinsic driven people

1. 	Extrinsic people are driven by external factors - money, fame and status
-	They can be highly successful but be troubled by an insatiable appetite for more 'stuff'

2. 	Intrinsic people's motivation comes from within - they want to accomplish something meaningful. 
-	These people are driven by a desire for autonomy, mastery and purpose.

# Drivers

1.	Autonomy - "Our desire to direct our own lives"
-	This is contrary to traditional management strategies, which are great for compliance
-	If you want *engagement*, self-direction is better
-	Companies which give employees periods of free time to work on anything, find huge value in the output of these periods

2.	Mastery - "The urge to get better at stuff"
-	We gain satisfaction from getting better at things

3. 	Purpose
-	Believing in a purpose drives people to do complex work, for free
-	Wikipedia and Linux are great examples of this
-	Companies are increasingly focusing on transcendant purpose as a motivator
-	If an organisation is focused on profit over purpose, bad quality products and services are delivered
