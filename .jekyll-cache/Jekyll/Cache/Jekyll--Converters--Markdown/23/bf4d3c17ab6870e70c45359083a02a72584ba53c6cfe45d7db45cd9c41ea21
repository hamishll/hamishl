  <li>Introduction: The Omegas
    <ul>
      <li>This book starts with an interesting short story proposing how a group of engineers might create the first AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) on a par with human intelligence,</li>
      <li>From within the confines of a lab with no external internet, they start using it to create software that could be deployed into the web and used to generate income - at first through Mechanical Turk, but over time through increasingly grander schemes which give the Omega’s huge wealth and ever-increasing control of the world</li>
      <li>Income</li>
      <li>Using the AGI’s strategic mind, shell corporations, and hiring real but largely un-utilised employees, this world domination goes un-noticed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How far off is AGI?
    <ul>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Technology and Inequality
    <ul>
      <li>Adjusted Income per US household tripled between 1930 - 1970, however since then the bottom 90% have seen no real increase since; the top %s have seen maybe a 40% increase</li>
      <li>Technology, including Automation, has played a significant role in distributing more wealth to those who own the machines</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Giving people purpose without jobs
    <ul>
      <li>…</li>
      <li>Numerous factors contribute to a sense of purpose and well-being:
        <ul>
          <li>a social network of <strong>friends and colleagues</strong></li>
          <li>a <strong>healthy</strong> and virtuous lifecycle</li>
          <li>respect, self-esteem, self-efficacy and a pleasurable sense of “flow” stemming from doing something one is <strong>good at</strong></li>
          <li>a sense of <strong>being needed</strong> and making a difference</li>
          <li>a sense of meaning from being part of and serving something larger than oneself</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>All of the above can be provided outside of the workplace, through sports, hobbies, and learning, with families, friends, educational and humanist institutions.</li>
      <li><strong>At a minimum, it should be possible to make everyone happy as if they had their personal dream job, but once one breaks free of the constraint that everyone’s activities must generate income, the sky’s the limit.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
