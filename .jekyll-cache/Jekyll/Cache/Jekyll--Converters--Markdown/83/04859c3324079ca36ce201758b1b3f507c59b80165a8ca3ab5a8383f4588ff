      <li>Have an <strong>org chart</strong> and update it frequently to avoid imbalanced structures forming, such as delivery pods which had a poor lead:developer ratio</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attrition has been a significant issue. Talent can be kept with:
    <ul>
      <li>i) better compensation (largely outside of UK control)</li>
      <li>ii) ensuring the team feels valued and happy (within my control)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
