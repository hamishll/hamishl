No notes for this one, would recommend as it's a quick read.

One passage I loved was this one, with its use of the phrase "Great rumours of travel!":

> "Whenever her father was alone with a dog in a house he would lean over and smell the skin at the base of its paw. This he would say, as if coming away from a brandy snifter, is the greatest smell in the world! A bouquet! Great rumours of travel! She would pretend disgust, but the dog's paw *was* a wonder: the smell of it never suggested dirt. It's a cathedral!"
