Twice as important as IQ and technical skills; even more so in
management

    rapport and finding common ground

# How successful people reach their goals

1.  Get specific about what you want to achieve
1.  Decide where and when you will act on your goals
-   Blocking-out time on your calendar is very effective!
1.  Shift your mindset
-   Focus on what you *will* do, not what you *won’t* do

# Craft a story to sell your (written) business case
Winning cases tell memorable and compelling stories

1.  Identify a strategic need or opportunity
-   Show how your idea supports these needs
1.  Lay out the project’s approach
2.  Describe *specific* costs and benefits
-   Eg: “reduce product returns by 10%, saving £30,000
-   Summarise these values
